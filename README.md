## Notes
- This application isn't finished yet. It's in working progress.
- Also, alter column description in movie_coming_soon table. Instead of column type String, set up to Text.
- e.g. ALTER TABLE cinema_db.movies_coming_soon modify column description TEXT;
- Before you run application, first, you need to create database. In MySQL Workbench, type this: 
- DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS cinema_db;
- CREATE SCHEMA cinema_db DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
- USE cinema_db;
- After application is run, also in MySQL Workbench add these lines of codes:
- insert into role(name) values("ROLE_ADMIN");
- insert into role(name) values("ROLE_USER");
- insert into projection_type(name) values("2D");
- insert into projection_type(name) values("3D");
- insert into projection_type(name) values("4D");
- these lines of codes are for testing only.
- insert into hall(name) values("hall-1");
- insert into seat(seat_number, hall_id, available) values(1,1,true);
- insert into seat(seat_number, hall_id, available) values(2,1,true);
- insert into seat(seat_number, hall_id, available) values(3,1,true);
- insert into seat(seat_number, hall_id, available) values(4,1,true);
- insert into seat(seat_number, hall_id, available) values(5,1,true);
- insert into seat(seat_number, hall_id, available) values(6,1,true);
- insert into seat(seat_number, hall_id, available) values(7,1,true);
- insert into seat(seat_number, hall_id, available) values(8,1,true);
- insert into seat(seat_number, hall_id, available) values(9,1,true);
